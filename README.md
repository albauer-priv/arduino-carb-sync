# arduino-carb-sync
electronic motorcycle carburator synchronisation device using an arduino and some pressure sensors
## bill of material
- arduino uno
- 20x4 display
- ERA 550492 pressure sensors (MAP sensors) eq. FACET 10.3195, BOSCH 0 261 230 289

## credits, inspiration
If you goolge for digital or electronic carb sync you will find several devices. Some on Git.
A few to mention here, which inspired me:
- Discussion in German Forum: https://forum.2-ventiler.de/vbboard/showthread.php?67592-Eigenbau-Synchrontester&highlight
- Repo yz88: https://github.com/yz88/arduino-digital-carb-sync
- Repo cuyahoga: https://github.com/cuyahoga/CarbSync/blob/master/CarbSync.ino

## next steps, bucket list
- [] documentation
- [] testing
- [] faster display handling
- [] measure arduino nano performane and maybe switch to ESP32
